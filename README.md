<h3>Why are we building this application?</h3>
<p>In the business world,the business card is very important. But then there are certain demerits to this thing</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each year 100 billion business cards are produced worldwide leading to the potential loss of approaching 6 million trees.Perhaps more shocking is the fact that within a week after receiving a business card, almost 90% of them are thrown away. Some of these cards will be recycled, but many will find their way into landfill.</li>
    <li>You need to carry it everywhere which makes it similar to clothes but businesss cards are not clothes!</li>
    <li>Most of the people throw these cards within a week which leads to waste of paper.</li>
    <li>In a landfill paper decomposes releasing methane gas that is over 20 times more potent a green 
      House gas than Co2.</li>
    <li>In US paper manufacturing uses largest quantity of process water per unit of final product with astonishing 324 kg of water being required to make 1kg of paper.</li>
    <li>Paper comprises of 50% of business waste 33% of municipal waste and 25% of waste going to landfill.</li>


 </ul>
 <p>So digitizing this process is the right thing to do, also keeping in mind the current CoVID-19 era. This will not only ensure your own safety but also of others.</p>
 
<h3>Workflow of Our Application:-</h3>

<kbd><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53506835/96382860-163cd800-11ae-11eb-8f57-7f2719b81e70.png"></kbd>


<h3> Steps for using</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clone the repo</li>
  <li>Open Android Studio</li>
  <li>Open Project</li>
  <li>Go to the location where you have saved the project</li>
  <li>Go to the java folder where you can see all the java files.That is the main project</li>
  <li>Connect to emulator or mobile through USB to use the app after running  successfully</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resources and Languages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>XML for UI</li>
  <li>Firebase for storing user data(Details about Firebase given below)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Firebase By Google</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Firebase is Google's mobile platform that helps you quickly develop high-quality apps and grow your business.Firebase basically makes backend easy for you.Our app relies heavily on it and we are thankful about it.</li>
    <li>What is best about firebase is that it is actually free. Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service — BaaS — and grew up into a next-generation app-development platform on Google Cloud Platform. It uses Google Cloud Platform which we couldn't use exactly cause we didn't had money so we turned to Firebase which is a very good alternative and we absolutely loved using it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Notes :notes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This app uses Firebase so if you clone this app all the data you enter would get stored in our database. So make sure to register your own app on Firebase in order see the data stored</li>
  <li><a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/?pli=1">Visit the Firebase site for more knowledge on this</a></li>
  <li>If you get compatibility issues go to android folder, right click and click on migrate and then migrate project to Android X.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Is my data in safe hands?</h3>
<p>This Application uses Google’s Firebase service to store and process data.Google uses  symmetric block cypher that is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to encrypt data at rest. All data at the storage level is encrypted with AES256 by default.Google uses tink which incorporates FIPS 140-2 validated module to implement encryption consistently across almost all google cloud products. 
So Be sure that your data is in safe hands :)</p>
